## DIFFICULTIES FACED

- There was some problem while dealing with images in `How it Works` section, as applying absolute position should not be affected on changing width. 
- I did not apply opening of new navbar on mobile devices, as it was part of javascript more than HTML/CSS.
- Also I did not apply opening of dropdown on desktop for top navbar items.
- I had to do research for the animation part of infinite carousel, I am still facing some difficulties with it.
